# raspi-heating-control
Project for having a webinterface to check the temperature and control a pellets-heater with raspberry pi. 
The raspberry pi is integrated in the LAN and there are some temperature sensors connected. The heater 
is controlled via a relay. 
The frontend is created with python/django and made accessible public through reverse-dns.
